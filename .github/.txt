### Import Path Conventions
- Use `@/` prefix for imports from the src directory
- Correct import paths:
  - UI components: `import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";`
  - Pages: `import Dashboard from "@/pages/Dashboard";`
  - Services: `import { useAuth } from "@/services/firebaseAuth";`
  - Lib utilities: `import { signIn } from "@/lib/firebase";`

## Firebase Configuration

### Authentication Setup
- Use Email/Password authentication
- Enable persistent sessions (browserLocalPersistence)
- Implement proper error handling for auth operations

### Firestore Collections
- `users`: User profiles and preferences
  - Contains onboarding status, profile info
  - Used to control access to various features
- `conversations`: History of user interactions
  - Tracks engagement with different AI personas
  - Useful for continuing conversations

### Firestore Security Rules
- Use the provided `firestore.rules` file as a template
- Ensure users can only access their own data
- Implement role-based access if needed for admin features

## Domain-Specific Knowledge
- Mental health is primary focus, not medical diagnosis
- AI transparency is crucial - users must know they're talking to AI
- Cultural sensitivity matters - support diverse backgrounds
- Privacy is paramount - minimize data collection
- Scalability is key - design for global reach

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Don't implement medical diagnosis features
- Don't store sensitive personal data unnecessarily
- Don't create addictive interaction patterns
- Don't bypass crisis intervention protocols

### Coding Conventions
- Follow React functional components with hooks
- Implement responsive design (mobile-first)
- Use lucide-react for icons
- Prefer arrow functions and const declarations
- Include loading states and error handling


### UI/UX Guidelines
- Use gradient backgrounds for visual appeal
- Implement hover animations and transitions
- Maintain consistent spacing (Tailwind spacing scale)
- Use primary/secondary color scheme from theme
- Ensure accessibility (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)

### Mental Health Context
- **Empathetic language** in all user-facing text
- **Crisis-safe design** - always provide help resources
- **Privacy-first** approach to data handling
- **Non-judgmental** interface design
- **Inclusive** language and imagery

### Key Features to Implement
1. **Real-time Video Interface**: Tavus CVI integration
2. **AI Personas**: Empathetic Listener, Cognitive Coach, Wellness Guardian
3. **Emotional Adaptation**: Dynamic response based on user state
4. **Crisis Detection**: Escalation protocols for emergency situations
5. **Personalization**: Adaptive content and conversation flow

### Performance Requirements
- Support thousands of simultaneous users
- Optimized bundle sizes
- Efficient state management
- Minimal re-renders

### Security & Privacy

- Explicit user consent for data collection
- Anonymous usage options
- Secure crisis intervention protocols

### Testing Approach
- Component testing with user interaction focus
- Integration testing for video/AI features
- Accessibility testing
- Performance testing under load
- Crisis scenario testing

### Deployment
- Web-based application
- PWA capabilities for mobile access
- CDN optimization for global reach
- Environment-specific configurations
- Monitoring and analytics integration
