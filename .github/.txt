### Import Path Conventions
- Use `@/` prefix for imports from the src directory
- Correct import paths:
  - UI components: `import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";`
  - Pages: `import Dashboard from "@/pages/Dashboard";`
  - Services: `import { useAuth } from "@/services/firebaseAuth";`
  - Lib utilities: `import { signIn } from "@/lib/firebase";`

## Firebase Configuration

### Authentication Setup
- Use Email/Password authentication
- Enable persistent sessions (browserLocalPersistence)
- Implement proper error handling for auth operations

### Firestore Collections
- `users`: User profiles and preferences
  - Contains onboarding status, profile info
  - Used to control access to various features
- `conversations`: History of user interactions
  - Tracks engagement with different AI personas
  - Useful for continuing conversations

### Firestore Security Rules
- Use the provided `firestore.rules` file as a template
- Ensure users can only access their own data
- Implement role-based access if needed for admin features

## Domain-Specific Knowledge
- Mental health is primary focus, not medical diagnosis
- AI transparency is crucial - users must know they're talking to AI
- Cultural sensitivity matters - support diverse backgrounds
- Privacy is paramount - minimize data collection
- Scalability is key - design for global reach

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Don't implement medical diagnosis features
- Don't store sensitive personal data unnecessarily
- Don't create addictive interaction patterns
- Don't bypass crisis intervention protocols
